title: "Bootstrapping your use of Containers"
teaching: 5
exercises: 60
questions:
- "How can I get started using containers in my research?"
- "Where can I get help to start using containers?"
objectives:
- "Get help to get your work up and running using containers"
- "Understand where you can get help from in the future"
keypoints:
- "Understand the next steps for you in using containers."
- "Understand how you can access help and support to use containers."
---

Now you hopefully know enough about containers to start to explore how to use
them in your work and to understand what the potential benefits are to you. You
may also have ideas around where the barriers and difficulties may lie and have
further questions on how you can start using and/or trying containers in your
research.

This session is designed to give you the opportunity to explore these questions and
issues. The instructors and helpers on the course will be on hand to answer your
questions and discuss next steps with you.

> ## Potential discussions
>
> Things you could discuss with the instructors and helpers could include:
>
> - Your research workflow and where containers could help
> - How to get access to facilities that support Singularity containers for your work
> - How to get help and support to use containers for your work.
>   For example, software development, further training, access to local expertise

## Options for this session

There are a number of different options for practical work during this session. These
include: exploring your own workflow with containers with support from instructors and
helpers or discussing topics with the instructors/helpers (as described above). The idea
of the session is to help you bootstrap your use of containers and what this means will
differ from individual to individual!

> ## Exploring your work using HPC
>
> If you have a practical example of something from your area of work that you would like
> help with getting up and running using containers, this is great! Please feel free to
> discuss this with us and ask questions (both technical and non-technical).

## Getting further help

Beyond the obvious documentation and tutorials that are available on the web, you may
want access to support to help you use containers in your research. This is where
*Research Software Engineers (RSEs)* come in. RSEs are people who have the technical
experience to help researchers use a variety of tools and technologies in their research
in a sustainable and reproducible way. Many different countries and institutions now
have RSE organisations and groups that researchers can contact for help and support.
A good place to start is the website of the [Society of Research Software Engineering](https://society-rse.org) which has links to international RSE organisations and local UK
RSE groups.
