## Introduction to Dockerfiles

We have seen use of others' Docker container images. Now we move on to describe how you can create your own images.

The specification for how Docker should build images that you design is contained within a file named `Dockerfile`.

In a shell window:
- `cd` to your `container-playground`;
- create a new directory named `my-container-spec` within `container-playground`;
- `cd` into your `my-container-spec` directory.

Within the new `my-container-spec` directory, use your favourite editor to create a file named `Dockerfile` that contains the following:

~~~
FROM alpine
RUN /bin/echo "Greetings from my newly minted container." > /root/my_message
CMD [ "/bin/cat", "/root/my_message" ]
~~~

A Dockerfile contains a set of instructions with options to the instructions. There are many different instructions available, we only cover a few here. See <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/> for a full description.

In our simple Dockerfile, we have three instructions:

   - `FROM`: Initialises the build and specifies the base image for subsequent instructions - all Dockerfiles start with this instruction.
   - `RUN`: Runs a command (using /bin/sh on Linux).
   - `CMD`: The default computational work that will be preformed when the container is executed using `docker run`. There can be only one `CMD` instruction in a Dockerfile.

## Building your Docker image

Run the following command to build your Docker image, noting that the period at the end of the line is important (it means "this directory"), and has a space before it.
~~~
$ docker build -t my-container .
~~~
{: .language-bash}
~~~

~~~

OK, now let's test that that container does what it's supposed to!

~~~
$ docker run my-container
~~~
{: .language-bash}
~~~
Greetings from my newly minted container.
~~~
{: .output}

Now use your favourite editor to make a change to the message that's contained within the `Dockerfile`. As the plan is to share your container online, it's best to ensure that your message is suitable for public viewing, and you may want to avoid including your name, credit card numbers, etc.

Rerun the `docker build -t my-container .` and `docker run my-container` commands to ensure that your image builds and that your containers function as expected.

While it may not look like you have achieved much, you have already effected the combination of a lightweight Linux operating system with your specification to run a given command that can operate reliably on macOS, Microsoft Windows, Linux and on the cloud!

## Pushing your container images to the Docker Hub

Images that you release publicly can be stored on the Docker Hub for free.

Let's "push" to your account on the Docker Hub the image that you configured to output your chosen message, in the previous section.

Ensure that your command line `docker` commands are able to reach the Docker Hub by running the following command:
~~~
$ docker login
~~~
{: .language-bash}
~~~
Authenticating with existing credentials...
Login Succeeded
~~~
{: .output}
(I wasn't prompted for authentication details, if you are, then you need to use your Docker Hub username and password.)

The `Login Succeeded` message means that your `docker` command line tool is ready to access the Docker Hub.

Note that so far, the image name `my-container` was used locally to your computer. On the Docker Hub, the name if your container must be prefixed by your user name (otherwise there would be many clashes when different users try to share images with the same name!).

You will need to run two commands that are similar to the ones included below, **except** that you need to replace the instance of "aturnerepcc" on each line with your Docker Hub username ("aturnerepcc" is my Docker Hub username!). A potential source of confusion is that you typically use your email address and not your login name to access the Docker Hub, however once authenticated your user ID is shown on the Docker Hub web pages.
~~~
$ docker tag my-container:latest aturnerepcc/my-container
$ docker push aturnerepcc/my-container
~~~
{: .language-bash}
~~~
The push refers to repository [docker.io/aturnerepcc/my-container]

~~~
{: .output}

In a web browser, open <https://hub.docker.com>, and on your user page you should now see your container listed, for anyone to use or build on.

## Copying files into your containers at build time

Let's rework our container to run some code written in the Python programming language.

You will need two shell windows. You can continue using the shell you've used so far in this lesson, let's call that the "image building shell". Let's refer to the new shell window that you open as the "testing shell".

Open the `Dockerfile` you created above with your favourite editor, and change its contents to match the following:
~~~
FROM python:3-slim

WORKDIR /usr/src/app

COPY test.py .

CMD [ "python", "./test.py" ]
~~~

Compared to our original Dockerfile, we see two new instructions:

   - `WORKDIR`: Set the working directory for subsequent instructions
   - `COPY`: Copy a file/directories from the host into the container

In your image building shell run the command to try to build your image (this will fail!):
~~~
$ docker build -t another-greeting .
~~~
{: .language-bash}
~~~

~~~
{: .output}

Our `Dockerfile` made reference to a file on the host `test.py` that should have been in the directory that contained our `Dockerfile`. It was not present, so the building of the image failed. It is the `COPY test.py .` command in the `Dockerfile` that is trying to copy the file `test.py` into the working directory of the current image building operation.

Using your favourite editor, create the file `test.py` in the same directory as your Dockerfile, with the following contents:
~~~
print("Hello world from Python")
~~~
{: .language-python}

Now re-run the command to build your image.

~~~
$ docker build -t another-greeting .
~~~

~~~
{: .output}

In your testing shell, within your `container-playground` directory, create a directory `test` and `cd` into it.

Test your container using the following command, which should produce the output shown below.
~~~
$ docker run another-greeting
~~~
{: .language-bash}
~~~
Hello world from Python
~~~
{: .output}

## Sharing files with your containers at run time

Having shown how to include files of your choice into your image as it was built, we now move to another important form of sharing: allowing your container instances to read and write files on the host computer.

Being able to share files between the host and the container allows you to build images that process input data sitting in files on the host, and write results back to files on the host.

Let's create an image for a container that uses Python to read in a CSV file from the Docker host, and write results back as a file on the Docker host. (As usual, the container itself, will be cleaned away when it finishes.)

In the same directory as your Dockerfile, use your favourite editor to create a file named `csv-to-scatter-plot.py` containing the Python code below. You can also [download this code]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/files/csv-to-scatter-plot.py).

~~~
# Libraries to include
import matplotlib.pyplot as the_plot
import numpy as np

# Read a CSV file "data.csv" shared to the Docker container from the Docker host.
# The header line is skipped, and typically contains a description of the columns:
# [ x-coordinate, y-coordinate, colour, size ]
# Each row of the CSV file (other than the header) defines one point to plot.
the_data = np.genfromtxt('/data/data.csv',delimiter=',',skip_header=1)
transposed_data = the_data.transpose()

points_x = transposed_data[0]
points_y = transposed_data[1]
points_colour = transposed_data[2]
points_size = transposed_data[3]

# This code is not at all robust, but skipping error handling makes it more brief.

# Define the scatter plot
the_plot.style.use('seaborn-whitegrid')
f = the_plot.figure()
the_plot.scatter(points_x, points_y, c=points_colour, s=points_size, alpha=0.4, cmap='viridis')
the_plot.colorbar()

# Save the scatter plot to two output files (on the Docker host).
f.savefig("/data/output.pdf", bbox_inches='tight')
f.savefig("/data/output.png", bbox_inches='tight')
~~~
{: .language-python}

Your Dockerfile will need to be changed to refer to this new script, as follows:
~~~
FROM python:3

WORKDIR /usr/src/app

RUN pip install --no-cache-dir numpy matplotlib

COPY csv-to-scatter-plot.py .

CMD [ "python", "./csv-to-scatter-plot.py" ]
~~~

Now build an image named "csv-to-scatter-plot" using the following command, which is followed by the output that that command produces for me.

~~~
$ docker build -t csv-to-scatter-plot .
~~~
{: .language-bash}
~~~

The `-v` switch to the `docker run` command allows us to specify a mapping between a directory on the host, followed by a colon, then the place that directory should be mapped to within any container that is created. Note that the default if for the container to both be able to read from and write to the mapped directory on the host. (This is a potential security risk: you should only run containers from images for which you trust the provenance.)

In your testing shell, create an instance of your "csv-to-scatter-plot" container.

For macOS, Linux or PowerShell:
~~~
$ docker run -v ${PWD}:/data csv-to-scatter-plot
~~~
{: .language-bash}

For `cmd.exe` shells on Microsoft Windows:
~~~
> docker run -v "%CD%":/data csv-to-scatter-plot
~~~

> ## You may need the full path...
> Sometimes, on Windows, the command to include the current directory will fail with an error about setting the neccessary access permissions. You can work around this by specifying the full path, e.g.:
> ~~~
> docker run -v /c/User/auser/container-playground/test:/data csv-to-scatter-plot
> ~~~
> {: .language-bash}
{: .callout}

If all goes well, you should now see, within the working directory of your testing shell, a PNG and a PDF file that plot the data from `data.csv`.

Change your `data.csv` file, and rerun the appropriate preceding `docker run` invocation.

You should see the PDF and PNG file update appropriately.

You have now successfully implemented an image that creates containers that transform input data through a stable, reproducible computational environment into output, in the form of plot images.

## Saving images to files

Rather than upload images to Docker Hub, you can also save images to local binary (tar archive) files (for example, to share with particular people, to archive for future use, to associate with a published paper). To save a docker image you use the `docker save` command with the image ID:

~~~
$ docker save -o my-container.tar my-container
$ ls -lh
~~~
{: .language-bash}
~~~
total 11480
-rw-r--r--  1 user  group   128B 05 Jan 11:23 Dockerfile
-rw-------  1 user  group   5.6M 05 Jan 11:27 my-container.tar
~~~
{: .output}

## Importing images from files

Once you have images saved in files, you can import images from a (tar archive) file using the `docker load` command with the tar file name (I deleted the container and image before importing again):

~~~
$ docker load -i my-container.tar
~~~
{: .language-bash}
~~~
